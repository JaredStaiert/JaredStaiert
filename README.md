## Hi there 👋

<!--
**JaredStaiert/JaredStaiert** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

- I mainly created this readme because it was listed in the instructions for me to get a student license for my favorite IDE!
- 🔭 I’m currently working on getting my second degree!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about AVL trees, and entity-component-systems.
- I'm looking to start getting into hobby game development
- ⚡ Fun fact: I asked my girlfriend what she thought I should put as my fun-fact and she said "that you drive a mini-van".  I drive a mini-van.
