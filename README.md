## Hi there ğŸ‘‹

- I mainly created this readme because it was listed in the instructions for me to get a student license
- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on getting my second degree!
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about AVL trees, and entity-component-systems in video game development.
- I'm looking to start getting into hobby game development
- âš¡ Fun fact: I asked my girlfriend what she thought I should put as my fun-fact and she said "that you drive a mini-van".  I drive a mini-van.
